VERSION

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    LogWarn is a "Plack::Middleware" component that will help you get
    warnings into a logger. You probably want to use some sort of real
    logging system such as Log::Log4perl and another "Plack::Middleware"
    such as Plack::Middleware::Log4perl.

CONFIGURATION
    logger
        optional, "coderef" that will capture warnings. By default it uses
        "$env->{'psgix.logger'}" with a level of "warn".
